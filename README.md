web-router
==========

web-router is a HTML5 router element for routing in single page applications.
It's implemented in and compatible with Polymer.dart.

HTML (declarative) syntax makes it easy to use. See [introduction](https://github.com/kornel661/web-router/blob/master/doc/introduction.md)
for some examples.

The project is still in the EXPERIMENTAL stage and is as for now untested.
